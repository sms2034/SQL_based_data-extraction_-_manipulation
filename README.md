# SQL_based_data-extraction_-_manipulation
*In this project, I utilized SQL to analyze a retail store's database, extracting key insights to take business decisions. I performed complex data manipulations, including aggregations, joins, and subqueries, to uncover sales trends, customer demographics and product performance. My findings helped identify lucrative product categories, the most valuable customer regions, and underperforming products, providing actionable recommendations for revenue growth and customer engagement. This experience honed my analytical skills and demonstrated my ability to translate data into strategic insights.*
